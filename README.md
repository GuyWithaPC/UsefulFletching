# Useful Fletching

A mod for Minecraft that makes fletching tables have an actual use

### Features
Currently, Useful Fletching just has a couple recipes that can be crafted at a fletching table.
* Poison arrows (3 arrows and a spider eye)
* Strong Poison arrows (3 arrows and a pufferfish)
* Cheaper Spectral Arrows (3 arrows and glowstone dust or glowberries)
* Blindness Arrows (3 arrows and an ink sac)
* Slowness Arrows (3 arrows and a snowball)
* Blazing Arrows (3 arrows and blaze powder) essentially works like a Flame bow, except without the need for an enchantment.
